650. 2 Keys Keyboard
 Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.

Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.

Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.

Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.

Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can at most get 3 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
A, A, A



Example 2:

Input: N = 7
Output: 9
Explanation:
We can at most get 9 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V



Note:

    1 <= N <= 50
    Answers will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
