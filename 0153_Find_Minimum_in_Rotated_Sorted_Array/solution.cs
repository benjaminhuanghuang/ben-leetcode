/*
153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

        otherwise, search from low to mid; Special case is the array is sorted(1, 2, 3, 4,â€¦), and 
        mid point to the first element of the array(1), so recursively find left part should include 
        mid itself.
