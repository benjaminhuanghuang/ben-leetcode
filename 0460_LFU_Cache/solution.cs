460. LFU Cache
    # 146 LRU Cache
Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. It should support 
the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, 
otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches 
its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. 
For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same 
frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
